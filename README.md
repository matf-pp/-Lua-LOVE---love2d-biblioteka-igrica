# Monster Escape

## Description
Monster Escape is a mini-game in which a monster is trying to escape a dungeon. To prevent this, the player needs to use certain obstacles and try to place them in a clever manner so that the monster cannot escape.

This project was made for the course "Design of programming languages", a course at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade. Its goal is to be a first stand-alone project which is to be done by students independently of college course material. Also, the idea is for students to learn a completely new programming language from scratch.

## Technologies used
### Programming language
The game is written entirely in the Lua programming language. Lua is a simple and reliable scripting language. More about Lua: https://www.lua.org/
### Framework
The game is designed using the Love2D framework for creating 2D video games. To learn more about Love2D click here: https://love2d.org/

## Operating system
The game is primarily designed to run on the Windows operating system (preferably Windows 10 or above).

## Running the game
There are no special requirements to run the game. All one needs to do is download and extract the contents of the zipped files and run the MonsterEscape application.
