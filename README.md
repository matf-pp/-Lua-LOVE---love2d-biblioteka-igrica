# Monster Escape

## Description
Monster Escape is a mini-game in which a monster is trying to escape a dungeon. To prevent this, the player needs to use certain obstacles and try to place them in a clever manner so that the monster cannot escape.

This project was made for the course "Design of programming languages", a course at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade. Its goal is to be a first stand-alone project which is to be done by students independently of college course material. Also, the idea is for students to learn a completely new programming language from scratch.

## Technologies used
### Programming language
The game is written entirely in the Lua programming language. Lua is a simple and reliable scripting language. More about Lua: https://www.lua.org/
### Framework
The game is designed using the Love2D framework for creating 2D video games. To learn more about Love2D click here: https://love2d.org/

## Requirements
### Love2d
To run the game, the user needs to install Love2D on their machine. This can be done on the official Love2D website: https://love2d.org/

### Operating system
The game is primarily designed to run on the Windows operating system (preferably Windows 10 or above).
